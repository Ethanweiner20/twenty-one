# Results

# PROBLEM

## Notes
- If the player busts, that as an immediate indicator of a result
- Two options:
  - We can still have one method that takes care of any result handling OR
  - We can intermittently determine the result during a player or dealer turn (for busts) and also determine the result at the end for card comparison

*Mental Models*:
1. The result can be determined at multiple points during the game (player bust, dealer bust, or comparison)
2. We will have one method to display the result
